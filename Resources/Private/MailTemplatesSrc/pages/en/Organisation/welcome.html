			<h3>How to get started</h3>
			<p>Your organization will be granted an administrative user account, the organization manager. (see above). This
				user account has privileges to invite other users to your organization, or revoke their membership. <br> Your
				backend account grants access to verification management and the Visual Skill Editor.</p>
			<p>To invite your colleagues to your organization, you can create invite codes and distribute them as you see fit.
				Created user profiles are private by default, with no profile data visible to anyone else outside your
				company.</p>

			<h4>Create your own Skills</h4>
			<p>Before you start to create your own skills, we suggest you get used to the SkillDisplay Methodology, and learn
				how skills are defined, structured, and how the different types of verification work.</p>

			<p>When you feel ready to start skill creation, we suggest starting with a single, well focused SkillSet with only
				a small number of skills. That way you cannot get lost in defining dependencies and formulating skill data.
				After your first steps you can build on your created skills, create new ones, or break existing skills down into
				more detailed skills.</p>
